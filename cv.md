## About me

---

My name is Evgeniy. I live in Novopolotsk. I’m working as operator in the workshop of the production of heat and electricity. At my job I do process management. If we talk about my personal qualities, then I’d describe myself as a goal-oriented and hardworking person with good organizational skills and strategic thinking. Also, I have many hobbies, for example, I play the guitar and I enjoy reading and bicycling. I love sports, that’s why 3 times per week I go to the gym. Also, I like to play basketball, tennis and sometimes I can go to play football with my old friends. . It all provides me with a good balance in my life
I was always interested in technology and at the moment I see my own development in programing, for this, I began to learn all about programing and also english.
